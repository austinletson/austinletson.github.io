I am a computer science undergraduate student at Georgia Tech. I live
in Atlanta and enjoy hacking around with computers, running, and
playing music with my friends.

I am fluent in the Java programming language and semi fluent in
Clojure, Haskell, and Python.

I am interested in programming language theory and development and
its applications to computer science education. I also love stories
and narratives and am interested in how computers affect story telling.
