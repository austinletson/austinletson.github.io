tengine is a text based communication engine written in Java for Java
developers.  Its primary function is to easily convert methods into
commands for an input stream using Java's annotation syntax,
eliminating some of the overhead involved with a text based program.

tengine is still in a beta stage but you can find the source on github
along with installation instructions.
